## SPOTIFY-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

This project is aimed upon building a music recommendation system that gives the user recommendations on music based on his music taste by analyzing his previously heard music and playlist. This means that computers will have to think the way humans do; analyzing each of the user’s last choices to predict what they would like in the future.
Music recommender system is a system which learns from the users past listening
history, popularity of the songs and recommends them songs which they would probably
like to hear in future.
<br />Library – Panda, NumPy.
<br />ML Model - Popularity Model
<br />And we used Dataset from the Spotify Web API
