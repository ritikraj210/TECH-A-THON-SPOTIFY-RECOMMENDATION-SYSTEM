# TECH-A-THON-SPOTIFY-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
This project is aimed upon building a music recommendation system that gives the user recommendations on music based on his music taste by analyzing his previously heard music and playlist. This means that computers will have to think the way humans do; analyzing each of the userâ€™s last choices to predict what they would like in the future.
